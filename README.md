**What is Gemolith?**

Gemolith is a next-generation blockchain, distinguished by its unique set of features designed for security, stability, and sustainability in a post-quantum world.

**Gemolith Core**: Gemolith Core is the software that is responsible for downloading and fully validating the entire blockchain history, including all blocks and transactions. The current version provides a command-line interface (CLI) for core functionalities and wallet management, with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) planned for future releases.

**Gemolith Wallet**: Gemolith Wallet is a component of Gemolith Core software. It is the primary tool used for interacting with the user's funds and wallets on the Gemolith network, as well as directly mining on the blockchain. Currently, it is accessed through a command-line interface (CLI), with a graphical user interface (GUI) planned for future releases.

 - **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:** Gemolith is secured by a combination of Falcon-512 and SPHINCS+ post-quantum cryptographic signatures. The core is built on the robust SHA3-512 hashing algorithm, offering a formidable defense against future quantum computing threats.

 - **Hybrid Consensus Model:** The network is engineered for a seamless transition from a secure Proof-of-Work (PoW) state to a more efficient and scalable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. This provides a strong initial security period before moving to a resource-friendly validation model.

 - **Strong, Multi-Pillared Tokenomics:** Our economic model is designed for long-term stability and growth. It is supported by a unique Dynamic Block Reward Tax System, which automatically adjusts a tax rate based on network activity. This system is designed to penalize whales from solo-mining all rewards with minimal effort. Our "slow" halving schedule, designed to allow latecomers to join in on higher rewards, further promotes decentralization. Transaction fees on the network include a standard per-byte tax (similar to Bitcoin) for the PoW phase, and an EIP-1559 style tax for the PoS phase to manage transaction traffic effectively. Additionally, a dedicated burn address is used for intentional deflation, providing a consistent mechanism to reduce the total token supply over time.
